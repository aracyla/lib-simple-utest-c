# simple_utest-c

This a simple unit test based on ( http://eradman.com/posts/tdd-in-c.html ) with the purpose of simple function testing(it's just a header with a couple of macro definitions to log the functions).

## Possible future implementations
- Output into a log file;
- Auto run mem-leak test(valgrind);
- GDB debugger;
- Makefile to run functions;

## Notes
- Runner.c is an usage example of these macros;
